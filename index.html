                <b>One of the most popular front-end frameworks in the world!</b>
                <p>Bootstrap is utilized by roughly 3.2 million domains, which is even more than jQuery which has
                  roughly 2.7 million domains! <i>Info pulled from the 6sense bootstrap analysis at</i>

              <li>
                <b>Started out as 'Twitter Blueprint' before becoming open-source</b>
                <p>
                  Twitter's internal tools were built with varying libraries and frameworks, leading to maintenance
                  challenges and inconsistencies.
                  The goal was to create a unified framework that would standardize the web development process across
                  the company.

                  Developers from all skill levels began to start using the software without any external guidance. Its
                  ease of use, comprehensive documentation, and consistent design patterns quickly made it popular.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Allows developers to add pre-defined styles and javascript behaviors</b>
                <p>To apply bootstrap styles, simply add the associated class to the html element. A wide range of
                  reusable, pre-styled UI components such as buttons, forms, navigation bars, modals, and
                  carousels are available.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>Quickly add reponsive design to your website or specific elements</b>
                <p>Bootstrap provides a responsive grid system that allows web pages to automatically adjust their
                  layout based on the screen size and resolution of the device.
                  This ensures a consistent user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>Guarantee cross-browser compatibility</b>
                <p>Bootstrap ensures that web applications work consistently across different browsers, reducing the
                  need for browser-specific hacks and adjustments.
                  It handles many cross-browser issues out of the box, making development more efficient.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>Add interactivity with JavaScript plugins</b>
                <p>Includes a collection of JavaScript plugins that add dynamic and interactive functionality to
                  websites.
                  Examples include modal dialogs, tooltips, dropdowns, and carousels</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>Offers various utility classes</b>
                <p>Alsp provides a range of classes that simplify the application of common styles and functionalities.
                  These classes cover tasks like spacing, text alignment, visibility, and more, allowing for quick and
                  flexible styling adjustments.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>Extra customizability with SASS and CSS</b>
                <p>While Bootstrap provides a robust default design, it also allows extensive customization through Sass
                  variables and CSS overrides.
                  Developers can tailor the framework to meet specific project needs, ensuring flexibility and
                  adaptability.</p>

                <p>
                  Bootstrap’s responsive design means that websites built with it
                  will automatically adjust to different screen sizes, making them
                  mobile-friendly and accessible to a wider audience.

              <li>
                <b>Consistent design</b>
